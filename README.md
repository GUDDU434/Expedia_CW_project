# Expedia_CW_project

In Unit 2 construct week we got the project to clone Expedia.com. It is a travel booking website where we can book hotel rooms, flights, cars, holiday packages etc.
In this, my contribution is the car booking part of Expedia.

1. In this, you can book a car from 1 pick-up point to a drop-off point according to your convenient date and time.

2.You can also book a car directly from Airport to your hotel and we also provide return booking too.

3.Once you select your pick-up and drop-off point, date and time once submit you will reach a landing page where we give you options and prices so that you can book a car.
